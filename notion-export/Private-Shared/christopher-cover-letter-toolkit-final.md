## 📍 Hook Blocks (Opening Paragraphs)

- **Tibet Cycling Story:** When cycling over a remote 15,000-foot Tibet mountain pass in 2014, I shared tea and tsampa with a nomadic yak herder. After hearing my story of shipping a broken bike wheel to a distant city for repair, he asked, “Why didn’t you just order it online?” That moment—a blend of absurdity, global reach, and shifting infrastructure—sparked my fascination with digital commerce, and it still fuels my excitement for building payment systems that power modern businesses.
- **Prompt Engineering Hook:** I don’t just prompt ChatGPT — I push it to prompt me. I’ve spent hundreds of hours iterating on workflows that combine storytelling, synthesis, and signal.
- **Substack Hook:** I’m excited by the opportunity to help build Substack’s creator and reader experience — not just because I’ve followed the platform’s growth for years, but because I believe in its mission. I’ve performed with The Moth for over six years, and I’m currently writing a leadership book based on lessons in decision-making and resilience — many of which were shaped by a 10,500-mile solo cycling trip across 23 countries. Storytelling and systems thinking are core to who I am.
- **Notion Hook:** I use Notion every day — for life planning, project management, outlining a book I’m writing, and even preparing a 10,500-mile solo bike tour I just completed. It’s more than a tool to me; it’s a system I’ve evangelized to teammates and friends. That’s why I’m excited to apply for the Engineering Manager role: Notion already shapes how I lead, build, and think.
- **Mercury Hook:** I’ve built systems that support financial clarity — both at scale and in my own life. My personal finances run like a startup: automated workflows, structured dashboards, and thoughtful constraints. That’s why Mercury’s approach to banking — powerful tools, clean interfaces, and startup-first thinking — resonates so strongly with me.
