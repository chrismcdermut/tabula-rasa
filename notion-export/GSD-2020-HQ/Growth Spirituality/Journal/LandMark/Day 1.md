## Second Assignment: Enrollment

### Maggie

-I've been pretending that.. our relationship is resolved or healed
-When in fact... we haven’t really hashed out what brought it to a breaking point originally
-The impact of that inauthentic way of being and acting is... we run the risk of having the same things occur and not fully understanding each other
-The whole time I've been being and acting this way, what's been missing is any
sense of.. understanding each other fully
-Standing there, the possibility I am inventing for myself and my life is... opening up a path for true authentic communication between us

### Heather

-I've been pretending that.. I am not in the midst of working through a ton of personal emotional history, not all of which is resolved
-When in fact... I’m still in the throws of deep emotional work and contemplation, and processing 
-The impact of that inauthentic way of being and acting is... I am afraid to share what I am working through because I worry it would be ‘too much’ or pull too much energy, be viewed as victimy/pity pulling thing, color everything i do in a certain concerned light
-The whole time I've been being and acting this way, what's been missing is any
sense of.. openness, authenticity
-Standing there, the possibility I am inventing for myself and my life is... confidently sharing what I’m working through and being open and not guarded and not embarassed

### Brie

-I've been pretending that.. sex was the main boundary to watch for six months of solo time
-When in fact... seeding and planting an emotional attachment/bond is what I was avoiding
-The impact of that inauthentic way of being and acting is... we had the wrong goal defined
-The whole time I've been being and acting this way, what's been missing is any
sense of.. knowing what behaviors to watch for and why
-Standing there, the possibility I am inventing for myself and my life is... being aware of what I am open and not open to and what effects they have on me
