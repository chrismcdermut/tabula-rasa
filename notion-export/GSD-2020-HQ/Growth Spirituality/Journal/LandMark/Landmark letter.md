# Landmark letter

I came to the landmark forum to fortify my assertive decision making, trust in myself and direct expression of what I have chosen with those I love, and accept that the communication may be openly received, or resisted and both outcomes are okay as long as I know and am confident in my truth and intention. In participating I am seeing that I have trouble fully embodying decisions I make for thick and thin for the timeline that I set, I see there are still aspects of fear, non committal and not trusting myself in moving in the direction I want. I am moving towards a world where I can observe a situation, circumstance, opportunity and quickly make a measured decision and stick with that direction in confidence, unwavering clarity and sureness that it is what is best for myself, most importantly and when appropriate, those around me. I will keep in mind that not all decisions are perfect and I can pivot when needed to pursue options that best foster, health and well being or new insights/directions. I am living authentically and want to express that the direction I head in is striving for the most fulfilled, confident, sure Chris I can be and understand that some people will receive, some will resist, and others will reject, but know that whatever direction Iâ€™m going in, it is made with self love and excitement that I can live with purpose and intention in creating a life where my core values come alive. I openly receive those that support this journey, and forgive/accept those that cannot.
