## Reject Thomas trade

Hi Thomas, I hope you are doing well and your trail  running has been smooth and smoke/fire free. I wanted to touch base and close the loop on this discussion.

I am not going to do this trade. Your rig is super awesome and well built; I'm honored that you'd consider passing it off to me. I have two vehicles right now and need to get down to one, via selling this gray fj80. my long term partner and I just split up and I'm not in any permanent housing right. It's not the right time for me to keep and maintain two rigs as tempting as it would be. Thanks so much for considering; I'll keep my eyes out for anyone looking for a 60(maybe a friend of mine actually) and connect you if it makes sense. Take care and thank you for your service! Have a great time in Virginia, ping me if you want to meet while you're on your drive out, I'm in Boulder with my sister while I figure out next steps.
