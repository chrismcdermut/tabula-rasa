# Consider

This is the place you want to be for the least amount of time

Gather information

ask questions

look at options but at a certain point you have to choose

Once you start revisiting the same options, it’s time to make a move

“How long does it take to make a decision, it’s instant”

Going to boot camp

Going to grad school

should it be more narrative or more box frames and structural

What is the best writing software? Should i just tell my own story or others as well? It seems like others as well bc that’s what I see in 4hww and sangaf and there are probably more relatable examples if it’s a spectrum, so fuck do i need to ask around my friends or use them as examples

i should write all my dating experiences, but that’s a separate project

what books do i like?

i should keep reading

timebox the consideration, it should not be more than the action itself

who is my audience?

is it best as a story or research

make a fucking decision
