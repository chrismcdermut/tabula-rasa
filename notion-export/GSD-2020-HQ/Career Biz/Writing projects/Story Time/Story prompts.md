# Moth Prompts

**Adulting:** Prepare a five-minute story about the highs and lows of coming of age and the trials and tribulations of getting there. Old enough to know better or wishing someone else would grow the heck up. Faking it 'til you make it, rites of passage and the great onslaught of responsibility. You know what they say: age is just a number.

**DRIVE**: Prepare a five-minute story about something that propelled you forward. Accelerating cars or burning desire, obsession, ambition or escape. Tell us about what keeps the gears spinning. Must. Get. To. Finish. Line...

**HAUNTED:** Prepare a five-minute story about getting spooked: conjuring a phantom, solving a mystery with the Scooby gang, or encountering an unearthly beauty. Lingering sweet memories or bitter regrets. Ouji boards, cosmic energy, the heebie-jeebies, and burning sage to discourage "visitors" from beyond...

**TRADITIONS:** Prepare a five-minute story about birthrights and rituals, customs and lore from those who came before. Friday night football or family FaceTime each Sunday. Bar mitzvahs or Quinceañeras, first piercings or tattoos. Dim sum on Christmas. The seven principles of Kwanzaa. Friendsgiving feast, or being a balloon handler at New Rochelle's Thanksgiving parade. Rites of passage that are dreaded or adored. Sometimes traditions are both!

**GENERATION:** Prepare a five-minute story about being a product of your time. Old fashioned or new-fangled, Baby Boomer or Gen Z. The glories and pitfalls of your age group, changing times, and generational divides. Tell us a story about the shared experiences that define us, the differences that challenge us, and what brings us together. Tonight we’re talkin’ ‘bout

**GIVE AND TAKE:** Prepare a five-minute story about the push and pull, an eye for an eye, a quid pro quo. The art of compromise-or lack thereof. Finding balance or disrupting the system. A tit for tat, giving in, or seizing the crown for yourself. What do you bring to the table?

**HUSTLE:** Prepare a five-minute story about doing whatever it takes. Lemonade stands to pyramid schemes, side gigs 24/7/365. Grit, persistence and thinking on your feet. Diving for the loose ball, or searching the couch for loose change to keep the lights on. Don't hate the player, hate the game, but whatever you do, can't knock the...

**HOME:** Prepare a five-minute story about where the heart is. Where you're from... your humble abode, your roots, your heritage or where your mama lives. Your comfort, refuge, or domestic bliss! Or perhaps a dysfunctional swamp with no lifeboat in sight. Your zip code, your people, your culture, your pajamas. There's no place like it!

**LEFTOVERS:** Prepare a five-minute story of what remained. Feelings, dinners, or lingering guests; the time there was too much or not quite enough; or the moment you couldn’t quite end things clearly. Cold pizza for breakfast, the last appetizer on the plate, family heirlooms, seeds of resentment.

**WILLPOWER:** Prepare a five-minute story about willpower. Tell us of your iron (or paper thin) resolve. Your battle with smoking, drinking, loving, eating or obsessing. Resisting the urge to check Facebook, read your lover's diary or sleep in. Caving to impulses or holding strong. Temptation versus self control and other epic interior battles.

**LOVE HURTS:** Prepare a five-minute tale about a love that made you go OUCH. The agony of deferred love! The misery of good love, gone bad! The anguish of one-way love! Bring stories of your heart, kicked to the curb by the people or places or things you love...or used to love. Love that "Hurts So Good" also welcome.

**BELONGING:** Prepare a five-minute story about fitting in or standing out. The ugly duckling amongst the swans or the new kid in school. Assimilation and alienation. Feeling right at home or trying to find it. Regale us with tales of what you belong to and what belongs to you.

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS:** Prepare a five-minute story about initial encounters. Blind dates, fixer-uppers, catfish, and long lost twins. When your gut instincts were proven right, or when you unfairly judged a book by its cover. Day one at a new job, new school, or new city. The stinky cheese that was actually scrumptious. The singer with the gravelly voice that you grow to love. The indelible mark made upon meeting somebody for the first time.

**RESET:** Stories from the latest batch, the freshly hatched, the brand spanking new and the born yesterdays... Prepare a five-minute story about a fresh start and detail how long the slate stayed clean. Bring stories about a new zip code, husband, haircut or nose - a wet coat of paint, the reinvention of your job or outlook, your previous reputation expunged from the records... Tales from the test drive of the new improved you! "New Car Smell"...but for your whole life.

**CONFESSION:** Prepare a five-minute story about big reveals to dark secrets. Tumultuous affairs bubbling up to surface with gossip or devastating accidents in which broken heirlooms and treasures must be revealed. Anonymous tips on perpetrators and obvious scoundrels admitting to their wrong-doings. Stories also welcome about secret admirers finally getting the courage to spill the beans!
