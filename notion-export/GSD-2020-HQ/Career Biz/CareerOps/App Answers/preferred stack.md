# preferred stack

Answer: • For full-stack applications, my go-to stack is TypeScript, React, and Node.js on AWS. When the backend doesn’t require tight coupling or shared types with the frontend, I’m interested in using Go for its simplicity and performance. I’m also exploring Netlify for deploying static and JAMstack sites with minimal infrastructure overhead. For rapid mobile prototyping, I use React Native on Expo.
