# Role fit

Answer: 8.5. I’ve led critical systems and high-performing teams through major product replatforms and infrastructure overhauls. At LegalShield, I managed an 8 person team through a company-wide checkout replatform supporting $250M/year in transactions. At Vacasa, I built the guest messaging infrastructure and retooled CX workflows, directly improving the most sensitive surface area for 3M+ active guests. While I haven’t worked in Go, I have deep experience scaling systems in production and picking up new technologies quickly. I’m drawn to Mattermost’s focus on secure, mission-critical collaboration—something I’ve supported not just in tech, but also through medical team volunteering and SAR training.
