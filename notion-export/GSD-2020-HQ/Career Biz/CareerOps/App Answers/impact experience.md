# impact experience

Answer: At Dun & Bradstreet, I led the re-architecture of the DUNS number registration flow—migrating from a WordPress-based marketing stack to a modern React frontend. This initiative preserved SEO equity while increasing user conversion by 30%, significantly improving lead generation for a mission-critical product line.
At LegalShield, I managed a distributed engineering team and led the full replatforming of the company’s $250M/year checkout system. We modernized legacy infrastructure, improved performance and reliability, and introduced scalable architecture patterns that enabled A/B testing, experimentation, and sustainable growth across a revenue-critical flow.
At Vacasa, I built the CX Tools team from the ground up, launching internal platforms that empowered 300+ customer service agents to support over 3 million guests annually. These tools reduced ticket resolution time by 20%, increased chat volume, and contributed to a lift in customer satisfaction during a period of rapid operational scaling.
Across all of these roles, I’ve consistently led high-impact engineering initiatives that drove measurable outcomes—balancing technical rigor, product collaboration, and user experience at scale.
