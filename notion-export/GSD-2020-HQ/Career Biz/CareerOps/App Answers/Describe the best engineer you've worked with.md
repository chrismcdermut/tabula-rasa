# Describe the best engineer you've worked with

Answer: John Howlett’s impact left clues across the entire organization—whether it was original source code, review comments, documentation, internal tooling, or company-wide wikis. He had a rare ability to think in terms of leverage: identifying the most critical business metrics, then designing scalable, reusable systems to move them.
He led the implementation of a design system that was adopted org-wide, standardizing styling and dramatically reducing development time. It wasn’t just a visual improvement—it was a long-term investment in consistency, velocity, and maintainability. John guided architecture decisions, invited collaboration, and made sure the system was intuitive and well-documented. His GitHub graph was a solid block of green—not just evidence of his prolific output, but of his belief that even the smallest components should be thoughtfully built, reviewed, and shared. He raised the bar for technical rigor, code quality, and developer experience.
One moment that stuck with me: we were debugging a persistent discrepancy in Google Analytics. After days of combing through the code, most of us were convinced the issue was in the implementation. John stepped back and questioned the analytics methodology itself. He was right—the root problem wasn’t in the pipeline but in the way the reporting logic was calculating events. That ability to pause, reframe, and get to the heart of a problem while others were heads-down in the weeds epitomized his systems thinking and data fluency.
Beyond his technical leadership, John was always ready to pair, mentor, and elevate those around him—whether direct reports, peers, or the broader engineering org. He stayed sharp through consistent study of emerging tools and trends and kept calm under pressure, communicating clearly and intentionally during critical projects. His mix of humility, thoughtfulness, and quiet excellence left a lasting mark on how I lead and build today.

Question 1: Why were they so great? What made them special? We're trying to understand what great engineering looks like to you and see you describe it in detail using a specific person. Having a reference point for great performance helps maintain your bar for future colleagues. Feel free to talk about who's set that bar for you, even if you haven't managed them.
