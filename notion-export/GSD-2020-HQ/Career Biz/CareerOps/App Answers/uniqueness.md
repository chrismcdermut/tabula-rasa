# uniqueness

Answer: • I cycled 10,500 miles solo across 23 countries from China to Portugal. I documented the journey on a WordPress site I built myself: http://biketoworld.com/. I’m now writing a book about the experience—on what it takes to pursue huge goals, and what happens after you choose and commit to aligned endeavors.
