# Why this role?

Answer: I’m drawn to Mattermost’s mission of enabling secure, mission-critical collaboration. As someone who’s volunteered on backcountry medical teams and trained with Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, I’ve seen firsthand how clarity, coordination, and reliable tools make the difference when the stakes are high.
Professionally, I’ve led platform modernization efforts in high-scale environments, and I’m excited by the opportunity to lead a team working in Go and React to build secure, high-availability systems. I also care deeply about developer velocity and the promise of AI-assisted tooling to support world-class engineering.
