# Why us?

Answer: I’ve maintained a therapy practice since 2017, including CPT for PTSD, and care deeply about making mental healthcare more accessible. Headway’s mission aligns deeply with my lived experience and my engineering leadership—I’m excited to help build systems that make care easier to find and more human to access.
