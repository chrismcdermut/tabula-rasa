# why us?

Answer: Outside of professional technology, I compete in and pursue large athletic endeavors, identifying, roadmapping, and training for big feats. In the past few years, Iâ€™ve done triathlons and endurance backcountry ski races (including the Grand Traverse, a 40-mile push between two Colorado towns that starts at midnight) After a decade of software work, I recently wrapped up a sabbatical cycling from China to Portugal, and in one year I aim to bag the FKT for the Badwater Classic route from Death Valley to the summit of Mt. Whitney.
I match my discipline in athletic endeavors with consistent delivery, impact, skill acquisition in technology while coaching and leading effective teams - whom I maintain relationships with for years. Teamworks seems like a great place where we can jump between nerding out on technology stacks and sport.
