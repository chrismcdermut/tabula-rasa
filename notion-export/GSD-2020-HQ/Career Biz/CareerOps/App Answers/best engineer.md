# best engineer

Answer: The best engineer I’ve worked with is John Howlett. He had a rare ability to think in terms of leverage—identifying the most critical business metrics, then designing scalable, reusable systems to move them. He led the implementation of a design system adopted across the org, standardizing styling and significantly reducing development time. His GitHub contribution graph was a solid block of green—he was a prolific IC, but also a servant leader who mentored through pairing, shared knowledge generously, and consistently showed up with humility, clarity, and care.
John brought a calm, deliberate presence to everything he did. He thought not only across codebases but across the org—connecting engineering decisions to product, business, and customer outcomes. He was consistent and thoughtful in code review, intentional in documentation and shared tooling, and often the first to spot how a small internal improvement could unlock broader team efficiency. He made others better—not just through mentorship, but by improving the systems they worked within and raising the bar for technical thoughtfulness.
One moment that stuck with me: we were debugging a persistent discrepancy in Google Analytics. After days of combing through the codebase, John zoomed out and questioned the underlying reporting logic. He was right—the issue wasn’t in the implementation, but in the math behind how events were being reported. That ability to pause, reframe the problem, and get to the root—while everyone else was heads-down in the weeds—epitomized his systems thinking and data fluency. He made me want to study more, document better, and build with long-term clarity in mind.
