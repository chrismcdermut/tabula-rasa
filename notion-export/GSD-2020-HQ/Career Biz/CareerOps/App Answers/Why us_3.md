# Why us?

Answer: I don’t just prompt ChatGPT — I push it to prompt me. I actively employ it as a writing and thinking partner: shaping frameworks, refining mental models, and sharpening decisions. I’ve driven it to map five-year goals, pressure-test relationship dynamics, model financial scenarios, and structure the book I’m writing on strategic decision-making and long-term execution systems.
Outside of work, I took a sabbatical cycling solo from China to Portugal — part expedition, part systems thinking in motion. It was a hands-on pursuit to understand how the world fits together and what it takes to achieve ambitious, long-term goals. I regularly perform at The Moth to refine my storytelling, and as an angel investor, I’ve backed automation and AI tools aligned with my belief that the future of work is shaped by systems that augment human creativity, decision-making, and output.
OpenAI feels like the rare place where technical leadership, strategic clarity, and human-centered thinking converge toward a mission that truly matters. I’d be excited to contribute.
