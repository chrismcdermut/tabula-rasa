# why us?

Answer: I used Figma at LegalShield and immediately preferred it over InVision, which I’d previously used at both Vacasa and Dun & Bradstreet. The collaborative nature, ease of access, and speed of iteration made a real impact on our team velocity. It’s a tool that has directly supported my success as an engineering leader, and I’d be excited to contribute to something that’s already shaped how I work.
