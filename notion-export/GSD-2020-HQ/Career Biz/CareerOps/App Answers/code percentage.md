Answer: • My current role is 60% hands-on coding with the other 40% split between cross functional collaboration, system design and architecture and career pathing engineers. I am proficient in React, Node Express, both using typescript and interfacing and working in C#/.NET back ends and microservices. In my Vacasa role, I dove deep into PHP admin pages to update and optimize are most heavily used CX flows as well as start integrating micro-React SPAs to migrate to a modern interface.
