payments experience,"What experience do you have with billing, payments, or sensitive data (PCI/PII)?","At LegalShield, I led the modernization and replatforming of our company’s entire checkout flow, which supported over $250M in annual revenue. We replaced three legacy systems with a modern, PCI- and PII-compliant platform using React SPAs and a Node/C# microservice architecture. The system had to handle different order schemas and databases, and support B2C, D2C, and sales channels — all while keeping the experience seamless for the user.
I introduced test-driven development practices to reduce risk in payment workflows and led the architecture of core abstractions that allowed us to scale across teams without duplicating logic. I also worked closely with Finance and Legal on compliance requirements like PCI, PII, and ADA to ensure customer protection and platform reliability.
Earlier at Vacasa, I built services on AWS (Lambda, SQS, API Gateway) to support high-volume messaging between guests and staff — not directly billing, but with similar reliability and scale requirements. That experience shaped my approach to building systems that are both resilient and customer-friendly.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7815a9b69e9014a702793?pvs=21),
customer empathy,What does being customer-obsessed mean to you?,"In any role, I make a point to personally explore user flows to understand the journey from a real customer’s perspective. I’ll dig into — or implement — the analytics stack to make sure we’re working from actual behavior, not assumptions. As I write this, I’m toggling through Zapier’s current checkout experience and already see an opportunity to save 44 keystrokes by implementing something like Stripe’s Link to autofill payment info. I’m always scanning for friction that can be removed.
At Vacasa, a tech-enabled vacation rental management company, I booked a weekend at one of our own properties and even volunteered during a cleaning staff shortage just to experience the product end to end. I apply the same approach to internal tools — at both Vacasa and LegalShield, I ran workshops with my team and internal stakeholders to make sure engineers understood what we were building and why. That context helped them contribute more to testing coverage, edge cases, and design feedback.
I also work closely with product and design to make sure we’re balancing technical feasibility with what actually makes the experience better for the user. Customer-centricity isn’t something I delegate: It’s something I model and bake into how we build.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7815a9b69e9014a702793?pvs=21),
Measure team performance,How do you measure the performance of your engineering team?,"I measure team performance through a mix of business outcomes, team-level output, and individual contribution. Business metrics usually include impact on revenue, costs, or NPS — depending on the product area. Team output is measured through things like features shipped, ticket throughput, and bug rates. And individual performance covers code quality, velocity, code reviews, and contributions to architecture or product direction.
I’m always looking for high-leverage practices that improve both quality and productivity. At Dun & Bradstreet, I introduced and refined a robust pull request (PR) template that significantly improved engineering habits. It increased code clarity, sped up reviews, reduced QA failures, and helped make us the highest-performing team in a $400M business line.
This small change also had a big impact on morale. Engineers felt more confident submitting code, reviewers gave better feedback, and the team took more ownership of quality overall. I originally drew inspiration from the concept of a “keystone habit” in The Power of Habit — something simple that creates outsized impact. I still use this mindset today: find the small changes that unlock bigger gains across performance, culture, and delivery.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7815a9b69e9014a702793?pvs=21),
Cross-functional Leadership & Scalable Systems,Tell us about a project where you worked cross-functionally with many stakeholders.,"At LegalShield, I led the end-to-end modernization of our company’s checkout platform, replacing three legacy systems and supporting over $250M in annual revenue. The roadmap included redesigning the user flow, re-architecting core services, and enabling flexible product offerings across B2C, D2C, and Sales channels.
I collaborated with 23 stakeholders across four lines of business — including product, engineering, marketing, finance, legal, and sales — to shape a roadmap that balanced business continuity with long-term scalability. We phased delivery to minimize disruption, while aligning on shared KPIs like conversion rates, revenue lift, and reduction in order-related support tickets.
One of the most rewarding moments came during the final phase. I had taken a customer-centric approach not just for end users, but also internal business teams. By anticipating questions and pain points, I built reusable components, prebuilt test suites, and extensive documentation to support asynchronous development. When I reached out to the last business-line scheduled to migrate in fall 2023, I was surprised — they had already adopted the system and were on track to deliver independently that quarter. That moment showed how thoughtful systems and clear documentation can scale leadership across teams — without bottlenecks.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7815a9b69e9014a702793?pvs=21),
Describe the best engineer you've worked with,"Why were they so great? What made them special? We're trying to understand what great engineering looks like to you and see you describe it in detail using a specific person. Having a reference point for great performance helps maintain your bar for future colleagues. Feel free to talk about who's set that bar for you, even if you haven't managed them.","John Howlett’s impact left clues across the entire organization—whether it was original source code, review comments, documentation, internal tooling, or company-wide wikis. He had a rare ability to think in terms of leverage: identifying the most critical business metrics, then designing scalable, reusable systems to move them.
He led the implementation of a design system that was adopted org-wide, standardizing styling and dramatically reducing development time. It wasn’t just a visual improvement—it was a long-term investment in consistency, velocity, and maintainability. John guided architecture decisions, invited collaboration, and made sure the system was intuitive and well-documented. His GitHub graph was a solid block of green—not just evidence of his prolific output, but of his belief that even the smallest components should be thoughtfully built, reviewed, and shared. He raised the bar for technical rigor, code quality, and developer experience.
One moment that stuck with me: we were debugging a persistent discrepancy in Google Analytics. After days of combing through the code, most of us were convinced the issue was in the implementation. John stepped back and questioned the analytics methodology itself. He was right—the root problem wasn’t in the pipeline but in the way the reporting logic was calculating events. That ability to pause, reframe, and get to the heart of a problem while others were heads-down in the weeds epitomized his systems thinking and data fluency.
Beyond his technical leadership, John was always ready to pair, mentor, and elevate those around him—whether direct reports, peers, or the broader engineering org. He stayed sharp through consistent study of emerging tools and trends and kept calm under pressure, communicating clearly and intentionally during critical projects. His mix of humility, thoughtfulness, and quiet excellence left a lasting mark on how I lead and build today.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a78179a26cc430a4cffaa5?pvs=21),

site performance optimization,What are some ways to optimize the performance of a website? Mention a few techniques related to JavaScript and React.,"• -Reduce bundle size through minification, compression and then code split so bundles are only loaded when needed.
-Separate CSS into its own file for maintainability, but inline critical styles for above-the-fold content to optimize First Contentful Paint (FCP) and ensure users see meaningful content quickly.
-Lazy load data to not overwhelm the client, one small trick is to preempt loading the likely next needed data (like the next page of data) to improve perceived performance.
-Can use memoization within react to avoid unnecessary rerenders
-Apply atomic design principles to break components into reusable, composable, shallow units to simplify render trees and make it more performant.
-Implement virtualization to only render what the user sees.
-For state management, keep state as close to components as possible to prevent prop drilling and unnecessary renders.
• Minification, compression, code splitting, inline CSS for above the fold FCP, lazy loading, memoization, atomic design, virtualization, colocated state
• Reduce bundle size through minification and compression, then apply code splitting to load only what’s needed per route or interaction.
• Separate CSS into its own file for maintainability, but inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content to speed up First Contentful Paint (FCP).
• Lazy load data and components to avoid overwhelming the main thread. Preload likely-needed data (e.g., the next page) for smoother UX.
• Use memoization in React (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo) to avoid unnecessary recalculations and re-renders.
• Apply Atomic Design principles to break components into reusable, shallow, and composable units—making the render tree simpler and more performant.
• Co-locate state near the components that need it to reduce prop drilling and unnecessary renders. For complex flows, use useReducer or selector-driven state stores.

I carry this Github appreciation and inspiration for developer community into my professional and personal networks via giving talks on developer workflows, tools and writing recommendations for colleagues.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7811d8305e5761202c002?pvs=21),
role fit,Why do you feel you would be a fit for this role?,"The most effective workflow improvements, optimizations I have developed with my engineering teams have utilized Github's robust suite of developer tools and CI/CD abilities. To ensure high code quality, I set up Github checks for peer reviews, Code Climate test coverage, complexity reporting, and passing builds & tests in Circle CI. Additionally, I have used other effective tools with developer productivity in mind: thorough Github wiki pages to onboard engineers in Uruguay and enable them to contribute/deploy production code within days of joining Hooked. I draft thoughtful PR templates which elicit information key to thorough peer and QA reviews. I firmly believe the ideal end-state for the software development lifecycle is automated testing and integration/deployment straight into production. With tenets of automation, optimization CI/CD top of mind, I am excited to contribute to Github's Actions team to promote automated software development life cycles across the industry.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7811d8305e5761202c002?pvs=21),
remote work ability,"What do you suppose are the challenges of working remotely, and how would you address them?","My main considerations for effective remote work are community, work environment(productivity), and communication. In non Covid-19 lockdown times, I work out of a co-working space to create a focused workspace as well as maintain a sense of professional community. During lockdown times, I work in a home office to compartmentalize work from personal space(ie, living room, kitchen, bedroom). I use a morning routine to foster motivation/productivity via making the bed, drinking water, meditation, breakfast, exercise and an outside walk. One of the simplest morning triggers I use to transition from 'personal' time to 'work' time is a quick shower and changing into 'work' clothes (casual slacks and a simple button down). During covid-19 times, Community wise, I maintain a slack group of engineers/entrepreneurs, call friends/family and network from home via http://lunchcub.ai/ For work environment and productivity, I work in the aforementioned office and use task tracking skills like prioritized checklists, time-boxing and Pomodoro techniques. For communication, I employ simple, effective tricks: all my online accounts have a clear headshot so no colleague has to look at a boring default avatar. Additionally, I update calendar working-hours and meetings, update slack-statuses (in meeting, eating lunch, heads down, available, etc); use annotation tools like Cloud App to supplement discussion of product mocks/bugs/UIs/etc; use screen recording tools like http://record.it/ and loom for video updates or bug/work explanations; Lastly, I maintain documentation in Github wikis, Notion pages confluence. All of these communication habits contribute asynchronous knowledge transfer/updates and personable online presence. A few things I can improve for the home remote setup is a standing desk (Varidesk) for ergonomic variety, as well as an upgraded microphone and web camera for production-level voice/video call quality.",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/2316509554a7811d8305e5761202c002?pvs=21),
