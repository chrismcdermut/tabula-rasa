        ▪ Untangling a web of internal language and org politics (e.g., “Groups” aka “Biz Sol” aka “Solutions” aka “B2C”) to align on priorities.
        ▪ Gaining full situational awareness across product and technical stakeholders (24+ total).
        ▪ Navigating two legacy checkout platforms and understanding their downstream dependencies.
        ▪ Identifying an ideal end state while balancing technical feasibility, MVP delivery, and business risk.

        ▪ 1 new SKU system
        ▪ 9 new microservices (maybe 20+ new endpoints)
    ◦ Aligned across two backend teams and scoped a path to de-risk MVP delivery before scaling.","• R – Result (full and early delivery)
