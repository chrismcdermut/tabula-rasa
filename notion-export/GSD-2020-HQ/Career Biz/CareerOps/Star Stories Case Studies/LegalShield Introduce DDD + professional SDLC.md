    - Goal was to maintain high team cohesion, scale the team sustainably, and ensure strong performance across a remote environment.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - Hired five engineers (three for my own team), integrating them across four time zones and ensuring immediate alignment with product priorities.
    - Six pre existing engineers were embedded via a contracting agency; I treated them as full team members and invested in mentorship and career-pathing despite structural limitations.
    - Conducted a full promotion cycle (promoting one engineer) and led a performance improvement plan (PIP) for another, ultimately parting ways due to persistent negative impact on team health.
    - Established team rituals—weekly planning, async updates, retros—and reinforced cultural norms of ownership, collaboration, and documentation.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - Your team shipped a multi-line business replatforming effort on time.
    - The three engineers you hired have stayed and continue to contribute meaningfully.
    - Maintained a resilient, healthy team culture across geographies and time zones.
