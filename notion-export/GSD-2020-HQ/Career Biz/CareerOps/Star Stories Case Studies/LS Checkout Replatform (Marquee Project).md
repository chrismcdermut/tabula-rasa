# LS: Checkout Replatform (Marquee Project)

Theme: Leadership in Complexity
Prompt: We'll dive into how you've guided teams through complex projects, adapted your management style in dynamic environments, and kept your team motivated during challenges.
Situation: S - Situation (messy mix legacy tech, on prem architecture and 1 previous failed attempt to update the system)
Task: • T – Task (get a lay of the land, connect with team/stakeholders, business)
    ◦ The key challenges included:

        ▪ Untangling a web of internal language and org politics (e.g., “Groups” aka “Biz Sol” aka “Solutions” aka “B2C”) to align on priorities.
        ▪ Gaining full situational awareness across product and technical stakeholders (24+ total).
        ▪ Navigating two legacy checkout platforms and understanding their downstream dependencies.
        ▪ Identifying an ideal end state while balancing technical feasibility, MVP delivery, and business risk.
        ▪ This required balancing diplomacy and direction, while gaining buy-in across a sprawling enterprise landscape.
Action: • A – Action (gain clarity on business/tech make roadmap)
    ◦ Conducted deep discovery across business, product, and engineering to map out the current state and unify stakeholder vision.
    ◦ Identified “Groups” as the largest and most strategically important line of business—prioritized its transition to the modern checkout first.
    ◦ Developed a roadmap to consolidate checkouts into a single, modernized system powered by:

        ▪ 1 new SKU system
        ▪ 9 new microservices (maybe 20+ new endpoints)
    ◦ Aligned across two backend teams and scoped a path to de-risk MVP delivery before scaling.
Result: • R – Result (full and early delivery)
    ◦ Successfully led the architecture and execution of a new checkout system to support all 4 business lines.
    ◦ Streamlined compliance with PCI and PII requirements.
    ◦ Delivered a scalable commerce platform foundation for future growth.
    ◦ Transformed a disjointed ecosystem into a cohesive platform strategy with high executive visibility.
