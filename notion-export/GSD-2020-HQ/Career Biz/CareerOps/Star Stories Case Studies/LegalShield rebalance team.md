### S -Situation

- **S – Situation**
    - When I joined LegalShield, the checkout replatforming team was composed entirely of 6 embedded contractors. Leadership wanted to reduce long-term risk and build a stable internal engineering core.

### T - Task

- **T – Task**
    - Hire internal engineers to complement and eventually anchor the team — without disrupting current velocity or morale, and while maintaining high performance on a complex, business-critical project.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - Hired 5 engineers overall: 3 directly onto my team, 2 onto partner teams.
    - Used standardized, role-specific interview questions to ensure consistent evaluation and equitable candidate experiences.
    - Maintained balance and morale between contractors and new internal hires through transparent communication, equitable project distribution, and a culture of shared ownership.
    - Led onboarding with central documentation, personal 1:1s, and pairing sessions during first sprints.
    - Fostered inclusion by encouraging participation in architecture discussions, rotating meeting leadership, and maintaining psychological safety across a remote, multi-timezone team.
    - When one engineer had a persistent negative impact on team health, I initiated a structured improvement plan. After sustained coaching and clear expectations, I made the call to let them go — supporting the team’s long-term trust and performance.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - All 3 of my internal hires remain and are high-performing contributors.
    - Successfully transitioned the team from contractor-only to a healthy internal/contractor blend without losing momentum.
    - Strengthened team culture and long-term delivery capacity while shipping a marquee initiative.
    - Reinforced a values-driven performance culture through compassionate but decisive leadership.
