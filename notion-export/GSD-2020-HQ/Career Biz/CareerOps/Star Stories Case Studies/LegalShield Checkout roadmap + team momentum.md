### S -Situation

- **S – Situation**
    - At LegalShield, we were running a multi-quarter replatform of the checkout experience across four lines of business, with six engineers across four time zones.
    - roadmap, milestones and accountability system did not exist

### T - Task

- **T – Task**
    - I needed to ensure the team was aligned on key business priorities, sustainably delivering on them, and learning/improving each sprint.
    - I also needed a way to track progress clearly and make sure engineers felt ownership and momentum.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - I led OKR alignment across engineering, product, and design, ensuring each engineer’s work mapped clearly to company and line-of-business goals.
    - I introduced velocity tracking through Jira dashboards (e.g., story points delivered, cycle time, cumulative flow) and built visibility into how we were pacing.
    - I ran sprint retros every two weeks, keeping them focused, collaborative, and action-oriented. I made sure feedback translated into real changes (e.g., simplifying stories, improving planning, adding testing guardrails).
    - When blockers emerged—technical or interpersonal—I coached the team through them directly and looped in partners as needed.
    - I modeled ownership and transparency by sharing progress openly with stakeholders and adjusting scope or expectations based on team capacity.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - The team delivered the replatform on time and was recognized by the business for moving one of the largest product efforts forward.
    - Maintained high output velocity
    - delivered early
    - promoted 1 engineer
