### S -Situation

- **Situation**
    - At LegalShield, I was leading a distributed team on a multi-year checkout replatforming effort. The scope was technically complex, but the team risked becoming disconnected from the broader business goals and user impact.

### T - Task

- **Task**
    - I needed to align the team around shared goals, promote innovation, and inspire a sense of ownership and purpose — especially across time zones and role types.

### A - Action

- **Action**
    - I created and shared a clear, high-level list of the team’s core objectives, tying each major deliverable to company and user outcomes. This helped anchor our work beyond just tickets or epics.
    - I built analytics dashboards so engineers could directly see how our features were affecting user flows, conversion rates, and revenue metrics.
    - I regularly highlighted individual contributions — from team retros to company-wide demos — to ensure people felt recognized and motivated.
    - I invited engineers to lead efforts, contribute to decision-making, and pitch ideas via a public “wishlist” of tech debt, tooling improvements, and experiments. We reviewed and pulled from it each sprint.
    - I rotated meeting facilitation and consistently sought multiple viewpoints during architecture and strategy discussions to build inclusion and shared ownership.

### R - Result

- **Result**
    - The team became more proactive and collaborative, regularly proposing improvements based on real data.
    - Several wishlist projects shipped and drove measurable system and UX wins.
    - Morale and engagement were high, and engineers reported feeling trusted, aligned, and empowered — which helped with both retention and performance.
