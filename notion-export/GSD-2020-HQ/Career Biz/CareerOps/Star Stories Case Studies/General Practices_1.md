### S -Situation

- **S – Situation**
    - At LegalShield, I was brought in to lead the replatforming of our checkout system, which required standing up a new team from scratch in a fully remote, multi-timezone environment.

### T - Task

- **T – Task**
    - I needed to quickly hire, onboard, and integrate a high-performing and inclusive team capable of delivering on a critical product initiative across four business lines.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - I developed a standardized set of technical and behavioral interview questions tailored to the role and experience level, designed to fairly assess candidate skill and depth across all interviews.
    - During interviews, I probed resume projects to evaluate system understanding, architectural context, and business impact.
    - I hired five engineers (three directly onto my team), with a strong emphasis on both technical excellence and diverse backgrounds.
    - For onboarding, I built and maintained centralized wikis and documentation across our systems, encouraged contributions from new hires, and paired new engineers with senior teammates. I also personally met with new hires for 1:1s during their first sprint.
    - To promote inclusion and engagement, I made sure project responsibilities were equitably distributed, rotated meeting facilitation, and regularly sought opinions from multiple engineers in architecture discussions.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - All three of my direct hires remain on the team and are high performers. The team ramped quickly and was able to deliver on a complex, multi-quarter initiative.
    - Our team was also one of the most diverse in the engineering org, which helped improve collaboration and broadened our perspectives in problem-solving.
