- **T – Task**
    - My goal was to **lay the groundwork for a scalable, sustainable engineering org**—both technically and culturally—while enabling the team to ship features quickly and learn from users.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - Introduced **scrum, sprints, retros, and sprint planning** to create a shared rhythm and transparency across product and engineering.
    - Coached five non-technical founders and core team members on **agile practices** and how to collaborate with engineering.
    - Hired and onboarded a **senior engineer** and two **remote mid-level engineers**, designing scope to align with their strengths and the company’s needs.
    - Taught the team how to **break down epics, write tickets, and estimate stories**, creating velocity where there had been chaos.
    - Introduced **CleverTap** for user analytics to encourage **data-driven product decisions** and feedback loops between product, engineering, and users.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - Transformed engineering from a black box to a transparent, rhythm-driven partner in the org.
    - Set the culture for growth and collaboration, which persisted after my departure.
    - Built a team that could execute autonomously, paving the way for faster, more informed product development.
