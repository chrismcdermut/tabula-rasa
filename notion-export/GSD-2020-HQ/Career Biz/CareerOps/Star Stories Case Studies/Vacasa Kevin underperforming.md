    - The backend-heavy work was outside his comfort zone, and he was struggling to gain momentum.

### T - Task

- **T – Task**
    - Help Kevin re-engage, build confidence, and find a growth path that worked for him — while still contributing meaningfully to the team.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - Used 1:1s to identify the areas where he felt more confident.
    - Paired with him directly and gave him smaller, well-scoped backend tasks like guest info integration.
    - Asked about his broader passions and discovered he was deeply into sneaker reselling.
    - Suggested he build tooling around that as a side project to sharpen skills in a context he cared about.
    - Encouraged him to see that growth can be multidimensional — not just within Vacasa, but toward *his* goals.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - Kevin regained momentum on our internal team and started shipping again.
    - He built sneaker tooling outside work, contributed to a real product, and eventually got *poached* by that team.
    - He found a role that truly aligned with his passions, and we both stayed in touch — it felt like a graduation, not a loss.
