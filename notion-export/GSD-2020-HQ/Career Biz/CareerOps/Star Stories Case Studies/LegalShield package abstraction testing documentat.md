### Context

- Company
- Timeline
- Project/Initiative
- Role

### S -Situation

- **S – Situation**
    - LegalShield supported multiple white-label partners, each requiring custom onboarding by engineering.
    - Onboarding was slow and brittle—engineering was a bottleneck, and timelines often slipped.

### T - Task

- **T – Task**
    - Reduce engineering involvement in partner launches.
    - Empower business and partner teams to self-serve onboarding, without sacrificing quality or integration integrity.

### A - Action

- **A – Action**
    - Designed a robust technical abstraction layer—a config-driven “technical package” defining partner-specific behaviors.
    - Developed extensive automated integration tests covering key contract flows.
    - Wrote clear, visual documentation that enabled non-engineering teams to follow the onboarding process step-by-step.
    - Partnered with product and go-to-market teams to iterate on usability and reduce complexity.

### R - Result

- **R – Result**
    - Enabled one white-label partner to self-onboard **a full quarter ahead of schedule**.
    - Created a repeatable pattern that scaled to multiple partners.
    - Freed up engineering time to focus on platform improvements, not redundant onboarding work.
