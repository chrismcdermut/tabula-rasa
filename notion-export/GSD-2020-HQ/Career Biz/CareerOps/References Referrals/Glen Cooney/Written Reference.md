# Written Reference

Glen wrote some of the most robust scripting and automation I have seen in my engineering career. Optimized, modular, reusable and documented are tenents of Glen's quality work as a full-stack automation engineer. Glen initially served as my team's QA engineer, writing a battery of test suites to run unit tests, acceptance tests and end-to-end tests on a monolithic PHP and react based component SPA.

Glen confidently tackled constructing a reliable, resilient CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building and deploying React bundles to AWS S3 buckets, and multiple serverless resources to AWS: lambda, SQS, and Fargate. His solid grasp of the DOM, deployment pipelines and cloud infrastructure make him ready to tackle complex full-stack engineering initiatives.

Most importantly, Glen is a solid teammate. He clearly communicates expectations of coworkers, suggestions, timelines, and blockers. Additionally, he creates documents to facilitate shared knowledge across teams and contributes foundational helper methods and patterns to enable his colleagues to operate successfully. I would gladly work with Glen again.
