I owe some of my most profound personal development to Asriel's guidance, leadership, and support. His weekly Toastmaster's sessions at Vacasa was a valuable opportunity to progress skills in conversation, speech, and presentation, not to mention, an appreciated respite from the startup-grind.

 I regularly attended his Toastmaster meetings along with ten+ participants who practiced table topics, PREP (point, reason, example, point) talks and prepared speeches all under Asriel's stewardship and encouragement. Asriel personally arranged a varied list of 50+ questions, answers, and topics as prompts for the group, recorded each speech time and produced visual time cue cards to faciliate successful meetings.

Asriel's most exceptional representation of leadership comes out in the extra time he lends to help his colleagues succeed. On multiple occasions, Asriel joined ad-hoc meetings to observe practice speeches and provided content reviews in our online forum. Last but not least, Asriel joined a weeknight Moth Story-slam, saved seats, intently listened and loudly cheered for my first Moth story for an audience over 100 people. Working with Asriel is a pleasure and you will be delighted to see him emcee an event and deliver a well crafted, paced, and relatable story or speech.
