Luis' UX skills span aesthetic UIs, product, and workflow design and team graphics (i.e., amazing team laptop stickers). Each design and mock is backed by thorough testing, user research, and iteration.

Luis served as an embedded UX designer with my engineering team supporting internal tools for customer service agents. Luis effectively collaborated with engineers by identifying modular reusable component patterns and performing design reviews on engineer's work. His teamwork extends beyond immediate coworkers in the form of mentoring junior designers and aiding other teams in design work.

The most impressive, data-backed user research I have seen Luis's research for overhauling legacy customer support pages. Luis focused on the initiative's goal to reduce agent wrap time and identified the key tasks and metrics representing the department's worst inefficiencies. To augment his research, Luis led a cross-department meeting to gather requirements from stakeholders and technical partners. Luis turned ad-hoc, unplanned pages into dynamic, delightful, efficient designs. I would gladly work with Luis to experience his designs and exceptional research.
