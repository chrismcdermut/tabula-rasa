# Written Reference

Danny is adept at leading multiple large teams, implementing large, high stake technical initiatives and identifying opportunities to innovate on technical systems. He excellently balances innovation with delivery by communicating refactor, tech debt and modernization to stake holders and planning phased releases to deliver value early and often.

He does not serve as a passive guide when directing, he rolls up his sleeves to contribute code, join backlog grooming  meetings, and mentor peer leads and engineers. Danny stood up the initial dynamoDB instance for Vacasa's serverless SMS, Airbnb chat and contact center integration, analyzed the CX team's velocity through Jira sprint reporting to troubleshoot delivery issues, and trained the Operations department in writing effective user stories.

Danny mentors colleagues to utilize their strengths, address gaps, and progress to higher potentials.
