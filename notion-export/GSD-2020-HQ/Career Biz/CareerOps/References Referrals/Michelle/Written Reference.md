Michelle is a positive, direct, charitable colleague who provides thoughtful honest feedback to help one reach their best. She expertly listens and reflects to provide insightful suggestions on myriad opportunities to improve.

Michelle and I regularly participated in Vacasa's Toastmasters' group to practice professional and conversational public speaking. Michelle suggested additional meeting formats to vary formats and provide structure to talks.

Michelle donated her free time on multiple occasions to support me in workshopping stories via online discussion and impromptu meetings. She went above and beyond to attend two local events and support me when presenting to an audience of over 100 people. Michelle is a supportive coworker who will help you master whatever professional or personal craft you pursue.
