# Written Reference

Jayâ€™s deep-rooted & homegrown Linux, game modding, networking, chatbot, scripting, and hacking skills are on full display in his professional engineer career. Vacasa spotted Jay's talents when hundreds of customer support agent colleagues used his personal chrome extension to survive negotiating legacy tools built seven years prior.

He swiftly transitioned to an engineering role to update the customer support tools by incorporating the features he scripted on his own. His redo of the company-wide reservation dashboard is impressive and high impact, breathing life into tools that have been neglected for years. His success continued across the stack into AWS to construct FIFO messaging queues, sms and sqs message handling lambdas, api-gateway, a dynamo DB and a fargate consumer; All using serverless and terraform infrastructure-as-code. His architecture is robust, maintainable, secure, monitored and passed with flying colors through his technical architecture design review.

Jay is a quietly powerful technical contributor who deserves much more credit than lets himself receive. He has a great grasp of the product scope, use cases, and edges, as well as rapidly accelerating knowledge in modern and legacy frontends, server, and serverless based architectures as well as docker and APIs. Junior members consistently use him as a resource for pair programming and knowledge sharing as he willingly provides support and guidance frequently. His work is prolific and consistent in knocking out multiple tickets at a time, always eager to pick up the next task. I am eager to work with Jay again so I can have a front-row seat to observe his excellent balance of technical acumen and compassionate coworking skills
