Kendra is an omnipresent security force striking at any threat, bug, vulnerability, or compromise across an organization. Kendra and I did not work directly but interfaced multiple times which goes to show how effective she is at locking down security across myriad teams in an large organization.

When submitting a technical architecture review, Kendra was the first to provide thorough unprompted feedback. Any vulnerability in company code repositories or AWS accounts is identified via her suite of scripts, tools, monitoring and effectively followed up. Of Kendra's own volition, she found a public S3 public in my teams AWS account, quickly communicated the issue and recommended solution. No threat goes unseen, unmitigated or unresolved with Kendra in your company. 

It is worth noting, that an extra skill that she has is public speaking, presenting on mitigating implicit bias to the entire IT/Engineering department of 200+ members, and providing excellent career advice to a group of fledging scientists and engineers from a local technical high school. Kendra is an amazing coworker whom I would happily work with again.
