### Written

Glen wrote some of the most robust scripting and automation I have seen in my engineering career. Optimized, modular, reusable and documented are tenents of Glen's quality work as a full-stack automation engineer. Glen initially served as my team's QA engineer, writing a battery of test suites to run unit tests, acceptance tests and end-to-end tests on a monolithic PHP and react based component SPA.

Glen confidently tackled constructing a reliable, resilient CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building and deploying React bundles to AWS S3 buckets, and multiple serverless resources to AWS: lambda, SQS, and Fargate. His solid grasp of the DOM, deployment pipelines and cloud infrastructure make him ready to tackle complex full-stack engineering initiatives.

Most importantly, Glen is a solid teammate. He clearly communicates expectations of coworkers, suggestions, timelines, and blockers. Additionally, he creates documents to facilitate shared knowledge across teams and contributes foundational helper methods and patterns to enable his colleagues to operate successfully. I would gladly work with Glen again.

Chris joined our small Customer Experience (CX) Tools a short time after the team was formed. He quickly made an impression as a personable and supportive leader, eager to understand every team member's individual goals and define a plan of how to make them happen. His technical skills were likewise formidable, as he helped us upgrade the Reservation Edit page and get our Text-To-Chat system off the ground.

Above all, I felt he always had my back and made a strong effort to empower me and my team members. He helped me become a better software engineer, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with him. Given the chance, I'd happily do it again.
