### Writing

- I am interested in an MS in CS to formalize my CS knowledge and identify the best approaches to building scalable, resilient technology platforms. I want to marry my solid business acumen with advanced skills in computer science and software architecture.
- Computing Systems is the most appealing specialization as it compliments my experience building full-stack applications and will augment my knowledge needed to build extendable, efficient and durable applications.
- Beyond my 9-5 work, I have self organized my studying and successful passing of AWS Developer, Solutions Architect, and Sysops Administrator Associate certification exams. I leverage opportunities to gain industry knowledge, such as paying for myself to attend Reactathon, PNW Techfest 3 and 2 years in a row, respectively, and attend 'Fireside chats' events with technical leaders. A breadth of professional experience operating in companies from startup size to public enterprises prepares me to perform successfully in an academic environment. I have implemented full-stack solutions using React, Angular and jQuery served by Java Dropwizard, node Express, Apollo graphQL, and c# dotnet backends. I even extend my work into infrastructure using terraform, serverless, cloudFormation, troposphere and heroku to operate as a well rounded solutions oriented engineer.
