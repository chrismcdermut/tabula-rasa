*I graduated with a 3.75/4.0 GPA from XYZ with a BS in Computer Engineering. I wish to study in the OMSCS program so that I can learn more in depth knowledge about Computer Science and apply those concepts to my job functions.  While attending XYZ, I worked in the business intelligence office writing SQL reports to provide projections for the financial aid office. While at XYZ I was a member of the TUV lab where I was a student mentor for various projects and a soldering instructor. For my senior capstone project, I was the hardware design lead. As a student I interned at ABC for a summer working with the hardware department. As a student I attended numerous hackathons across the country, and my team became one of the top teams in the country. After graduation, I worked full time as an CE for ABC in the hardware department. I designed custom PCB's and wrote embedded software. I worked there for 3 years, but before I left ABC for another company, I was the DSP lead for a project as well as the embedded software lead for another project. I now work for a company named QRT as a software engineering manager.  I am particularly interested in operating systems and networking and the roles those areas play in embedded software.*

- **The Personal Statement is SEPARATE from your Resume! You MUST write a Personal Statement - pointing us to your Resume is NOT acceptable!**
- **Keep it short!**
- **Lead off with your academic credentials** – you are applying to an academic position – not a new job!

## Bits n' Pieces

### Snippets

-inspired by nomad

A few years ago, I sat down on my bicycle seat to begin an 11,900 mile journey from Indonesia through Southeast Asia and China. I sought to expand my studies in Political Economy, concentrating on 'Mechanisms of Globalization', and Chinese at UC Berkeley through a firsthand look at development and globalization. I had the analytical framework via formal education, which I built upon through direct observation and cultural interface:(specifics here? eating in street markets, sleeping in temples and mosques, and even swimming the US ambassadors estate in Laos.)  With each new mile, I observed and learned more: that my Indonesian surf partner considers 50, 'old age'; that the industrial food system has transformed millions of acres of Malay, Indonesian, and Thai jungle into palm oil fields; and to never look a Makak in the eye as they view that as a serious call to fight; that a local dialect can change from one village to the next. 

technology's role, or lack thereof, formed A thread  of observation in life in the developing world. No matter the geography, house or shack size, crop type, every household leapfrogged desktop computing to mobile devices; friends made along the way I stayed connected with on Whatsapp, Facebook, and WeChat; and the motorcycle shop a friend distributed parts to, desperately needed a software base POS system to replace their paper tags, hand written invoices, receipts and paper inventory tracking sheets.

After 10,000 miles, at 10,000ft elevation, high in Sichuan, China's alpine mountains, my bicycle wheel(rim?) broke, forcing me to scour each and every shop(wc) for parts, in the nearest township: Dawu, a Tibetan outpost on the plateau. Failure to find suitable replacements in local brick-and-mortar forced me to search online, connect with a reputable bike shop, ship the broken wheel to Chengdu, China, the nearest big city, and wait two weeks for it to be rebuilt and returned. 

Later that month, back on the road, a nomadic yak herder called me in for tea after watching me toil up an arduous, 15,000 foot mountain pass. We exchanged stories, questions, and vignettes of our respective lives; he explained that when I come back in the winter, he and his herd will be 3000ft lower in the valley and back in highlands over summer, following the best grasses and temperatures. Upon hearing of my broken rim ordeal/debacle, he simply suggested "Why didn't you just order your wheel on Alibaba(China's Amazon)?" I was flabbergasted that such an advanced solution pervaded even the most remote corners of China. 

Most would not expect a Tibetan nomadic yak herder to spawn/inspire one's computer science career, but his comment helped me recognize China and the Southeast Asian developing world's adoption, and sometimes need for, technology and software innovations as opportunities for job creation and economic well-being. Thus upon return to the US, I enrolled in a five month software engineering apprenticeship: Sabio. My eight cohort members and I operated as an agile engineering team, ultimately delivering a robust full-stack film production management app, KrewUp, to our client. Each new feature came with its own new challenge from 'Google Places API' integration for location information to regex for form field validation. It was not easy.

Continuing from the apprenticeship into a professional individual contributor role was an intimidating prospect, to be honest. I entered this software engineering field without a degree in computer science or prior experience in the field to rely upon for success. Instead, I utilized experience I did have as an editor at UC Berkeley’s daily newspaper to drive my team to be the most productive in Trade Credit at Dun and Bradstreet (D&B), and promote to Lead Engineer. D&B is a publicly traded, 5,000 employee, $4.2 billion dollar business intelligence company. The Daily Californian is a 250 person, $1 million dollar daily newspaper. Outwardly, these two entities appear dissimilar, but technology groups and newsrooms have a striking resemblance: many teams must coalesce to consistently deliver new features or content on tight deadlines. The complexity and pressure to deliver can be trying, but I was able to effectively lead teams in both environments by fostering ownership, collaboration and communication.

Before I took over as Photo Editor at The Daily Californian in Spring 2011, the newspaper was rarely able to publish photos that effectively complemented written articles due to significant obstacles in communication and poor high-level organization. At the beginning of my term, I facilitated meetings with department editors to identify gaps in photo assignments and I restructured shifts and communication methods to increase the photos published per staff member by 30%. I am proud to have managed the visual element of our paper that led us to win #1 California College Newspaper in 2011, 2012.

At D&B, my team struggled to find cadence with limited resources and backlog of work, often falling short of our feature commitments and story-point targets. I identified that we needed to increase productivity without additional resources, so I focused the team on a singular goal: to streamline our ability to produce higher quality code. I analyzed discrepancies between our productivity commitments and delivery, and worked backwards to determine the holes in our knowledge, skills, and collaboration that were stifling output. In the following months, I facilitated team discussions to promote a sense of ownership in resolving our inefficiencies together.

Pressure to deliver fostered a practice of haphazardly merging untested code into future production builds. Features were often left incomplete or flawed, needing to be reworked, sometimes coming back as consumer helpdesk issues. I wanted to reinforce a sense of ownership over our features, so I worked with my teammates to set a standard to locally test code and implement a review template which documents set-up, testing steps, expected results, and proof of functionality. There were concerns about increased workload, however, I was able to show data demonstrating a reduction in repeat work which alleviated these worries. As we thoroughly reviewed more pieces of our application, we increased product and technical knowledge and caught bugs early and often. This increased knowledge fostered our team’s sense of ownership over the entire product, as opposed to individual tasks. These optimizations increased our output 21%, making us the most productive team in the D&B Credit Suite. In 2017, our team has produced 97 story-points per developer, compared with 68 and 52 on “D&B Credit” and “Credit Builder”, respectively.

Our department gained confidence in summer 2017, when I organized an office-wide team of 20 coworkers to compete in the AT&T SHAPE hackathon: a 24-hour coding event to build a virtual reality app. We were immensely proud to place in the final 10 out of 74 teams considering we build business credit products. Our confidence grew further in Spring 2018 when I organized a group to compete in Reactathon's hackathon, and build a parking sign analyzer app using react-native and AWS Rekognition to accurately read clusters of signs determine parking eligibility. The Judges awarded our app 2nd place, along with a flat screen tv and ps4. 

To compliment years at a large public, established company, I networked with LA entrepreneurs to find a smaller, agile, high autonomy environments. Via interviews with cofounders and advisor Ryan Ogle, Tinder's CTO, Hooked, a mobile app delivering deals for restaurants around college campuses, presented itself as a an excellent opportunity. The group offered me to opportunity to lead Hooked away from six years of contracted out agency development and mentor stakeholders on learning how to bring engineers in house and adopt best practices of agile software development lifecycles, data driven decisions and minimum viable products. I cut 3 month projects into 2 week deliverables, introduced something something and identified frictionless onboarding paths with 20% more completion. Being a startup, I like to joke I operated as 100% individual contributor, 100% manager and 100% product owner, 100% project manager, at least. At each turn in my career, I bolster my abilities through big projects, leadership roles, studies, and extracurriculars. Any gap in knowledge I seek to fill via experience, studies or extracurriculars. 

Each project, hackathon, role and course I use as a stepping stone to flex recently acquired skills. Hooked launched me into the next phase of my software engineering career, Engienering Team Lead roles in mature, corporate settings: managing direct reports, career mapping, identifying and measuring success metrics. I found an opportunity to utilize these skills in Vacasa, a mid-size, Series D growth company, which fully manages short term rental properties. We create top tier listing inventory through professional photography, search optimized copy and Our proprietary software programaticaly distirbutes and updates the inventory on 35+ platforms: Airbnb, 'Booking.com', VRBO, HomeAway, etc. Vacasa needed my abilities in business acumen, team building and roadmapping to lower operational costs in customer support as we scaled from 25,000 to 50,000 units under management. I stood up a brand new team of engineers to introduce new features and implement new tools to lower Customer Experience handle and wrap time across ~400 CX agents and improve customer NPS. My most impactful project manifested in a 'text-to-chat' service allowing our 50,000+ guests to contact and inquire via SMS, which CX agents could coordinate and resolve in 1/4 the time of a phone call. 'Text-to-chat' was Vacasa engineering org highlight, receiving accolades from CEO, and CTO leadership as well as Twilio integration engineers. The process of architecting and implementing a high volume, scalable, durable serverless event driven system highlighted gaps in knowledge I wanted to bolster and fill. I leaned on Vacasa's architecture review group, but saw this full-stack knowledge as necessary background knowledge to serve as an effective engineering leader, to do x y and z.

When COVID-19 travel restrictions limited bookings by 95%, and forcing the company the restrict staffing to 1/4 the team size, but gave me the opportunity to transfer my 9-5 work from corporate obligations to professional development. Throughout the height of COVID-19 lockdowns I studied and pass the three core AWS certifications: AWS Developer, AWS Solutions Architect, AWS SysOps administrator. In the hour leading up to my Sysops exam, I had a final interview with Arnold Blinn, former GoDaddy Chief Architect and current Legalshield CTO. I am ecstatic to exercise my DNB enterprise SASS and startup team forming  and Architecting skills from Hooked and Vacasa to mature Legalshield's enginereing org and provide comprehensive legal coverage for individuals, familys and business at affordable prices in seamless experiences. As I look for opportunities to continue growing/expanifgn my knowledge in software engineering, I am incredibly excited to matriculate a Computer Science program to formalize the knowledge I need to serve as a proficient technical and business leader.

I am now Lead Engineer for an initiative to revamp D&B’s DUNS number registration: often customers’ first introduction to our company. I plan to employ habits fostered in my previous role to reach success again in this new project. Management has asked us to evangelize and implement my habits of ownership and collaboration on teams throughout the organization.

suggested to simply order a replacement on Taobao (China’s Amazon). I was surprised that such an advanced solution pervaded even remote corners of China and found technology utilized in essential economic functions: commerce, communication, transportation and payments. I recognized China’s innovations as opportunities for job creation and economic well-being, thus upon return to the US, I enrolled in a five month software engineering apprenticeship: Sabio. I was thrilled to acquire skills in computer programming and application development to launch my career in software development at Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), following the program.

~~Beginning at D&B, I sought opportunities to improve my teams production adn~~ 

I entered my current career as a software engineer without a degree in computer science or prior experience in the field to rely upon for success. Instead, I utilized experience I did have as an editor at UC Berkeley’s daily newspaper to drive my team to be the most productive in Trade Credit at Dun and Bradstreet (D&B), and recently a promotion to Lead Engineer. D&B is a publicly traded, 5,000 employee, $4.2 billion dollar business intelligence company. *The Daily Californian* is a 250 person, $1 million dollar daily newspaper. Outwardly, these two entities appear dissimilar, but technology groups and newsrooms have a striking resemblance: many teams must coalesce to consistently deliver new features or content on tight deadlines. The complexity and pressure to deliver can be trying, but I was able to effectively lead teams in both environments by fostering ownership, collaboration and communication.

I took the initiative to expand my responsibilities beyond software development in order to better understand the context of the product that I was building. I began to dialogue with business analysts, data engineers, and product owners to understand each feature’s business value and process. When our team leader transitioned to fill another team’s vacancy, I was promoted to Team Leader because of my motivation to understand business opportunities as well as my successful leadership. Within my new role, I trained the software engineers to learn all levels of product development and delivery in order to prevent bottlenecks in the production line. Everyone is capable of performing these tasks when given confidence and guidance.

Our department gained confidence this summer, when I organized an office-wide team of 20 coworkers to compete in the AT&T SHAPE hackathon: a 24-hour coding event to build a virtual reality app. We were immensely proud to place in the final 10 out of 74 teams considering we build business credit products.
