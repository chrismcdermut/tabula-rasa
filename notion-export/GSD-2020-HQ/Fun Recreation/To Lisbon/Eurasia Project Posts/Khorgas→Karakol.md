# Khorgas→Karakol

6/14→6/16
Day 72→74
4264→4454km (2649→2676mi)
Haven’t crossed a new-to-me country’s border by bike in a long time: 11 years (the last being Burma in 2013)
Felt a balanced mix of excitement to progress into Central Asia, and insecurity leaving a familiar region, and language, behind.
In the first meters of Kazakhstan - I executed the bare essential; exchange some money with a border area food vendor (swallowed the unfavorable rate), hit the road.
Zharkent was my original goal, but I adjusted on the fly as it proved to be out of the way from the unmapped road I found myself on pushing through empty steppe, and the first village, opting to knock out some mileage and climbing, reaching “Chondzy” just after dusk.
Anxiety crept up as I rolled into town not yet knowing how/where to source the basics: accommodation and a meal, let alone get more than a spinning wheel on google. Luckily, I find an open restaurant, identify a nearby guesthouse and sort the evening. Soon enough, I remember I’m already prepped for the basics: bike, tent, food. Anything beyond is additional comfort.
Chondzy to Kegen brings me up from flat steppe and back onto a higher mess of wrinkled mountains. Chondzy to the mountains edge is empty, a few cars, a couple houses and only 1 shade tree. Central Asia starkly contrasts the bustle and populous of China.
Kegen is set in a mini basin with rolling grass hills to the north and blooming hayfields running to the base of snow and stone topped Tian Shan ridges in the south. It is one of the prettiest settings of the whole trip and, in hindsight, would have been worth a full day. I spent the evening with 3 long distance cyclists I met coming into town, first of the trip!

Kegen to Karakol was a full day. Stunning scenery of grasslands and ridgelines, my next border crossing into Kyrgyzstan (have already shaken off new country nerves), a happenstance encounter of this region’s nomadic horse games: kokboro, where horsemen carry a headless calf as others bludgeon the holding rider in an effort to steal the calf and become the new carrier.

Rolling from this corner of Kazakstan into Kyrgyzstan does not lack in it’s offering of inviting landscapes continued grasslands, dominating ridgelines and an colorful artist’s pallet bee boxes, fields and soviet homes/vehicles. Not too mention meeting 4 more cyclists!
