After a few days of hanging with Elyar, wrestling with Tajik and Uzbek e-visas, and prepping to embark on new territory, I cycled one day to the border port, Khorgas, a town I’d been loosely familiar with for the last 10 years when contemplating a full continued journey westward to reach the Atlantic.

I arrived 30 minutes too late to border hours after accidentally going to the old port, a fortunate event as a cycling friend, “Chen Ajie”, caught up to me via hitching. Despite goodbyes 900 miles earlier, we relished the opportunity to share a few last beers and barbecue.

China is where I cut my teeth on solo international travel (and travel in general), 13 years ago, in [2011](http://2011.it): Only the second time I’d flown abroad after a one week trip to Peru in 2009. My two months there laid the foundation not just for my mandarin and travel skills, but the confidence to create opportunities, dive into unfamiliar terrain, respond to life’s continual dynamism and emerging challenges.

It served as the initial focal point for an extended bike trip and eventual fulcrum for a world tour. Beginning in middle school, fueled by the rise of the internet and ability to peruse photos of the world I dreamt of pursuing an overland crossing from Asia to Europe. A trip like this was even the third (10-20%), less strategic, muse-like reason to begin learning Mandarin to complement my Political Economy studies: “I’ll get us (referring to David Herschorn) through East Asia, and David will get us through the Middle East” I’d said..

In 2014, after 2013’s ~10 months of riding in SouthEast Asia, and one month at home (US) I returned to China to fulfill the bike trips original goal: familiarize with China, practice Mandarin. A full continental crossing required more than I had left in the tank: new languages, regional super powers, thousands additional miles, and continued months of travel..

Cycling from Shanghai, I chose Xining as an interim milestone, the demarcation between China’s developed, densely populated east and its desolate, impoverished western counterpart. Xining lies on the demographic edge of China’s population, but the (almost) literal geographic center of this geopolitical land mass (3rd largest behind Russia and Canada)

I did not truly fathom how much cycling through China remained. When perusing maps this last Fall ‘23, staring into 1000+ mile beige and grey voids of Gobi, Taklamakan desert and steppe terrains, my hope to continuously cycle the globe seemed frivolous, prompting me to mull over skipping this section altogether, altering my dreams, adjusting my goal.

With consideration, I chose to make an attempt, allowing myself the option to stick out a thumb and hop on a freight truck if the landscape proved too harsh or numbingly boring.

Neither predicament transpired as I traversed the transition from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau through high Gobi desert to the Tian Shan mountains’ eastern fringes. The desolation pushed me into some of the deepest flow states I’ve ever experienced, and the vast, expansive landscapes provided opportunities to see and digest what a feat it is to reach each next horizon line.

The port is marked by a grand (and imposing) structure emulating the ancient border fortresses of Jiayuguan pass and especially Yumen “Jade gate”: key former entrances to the country’s interior. Stepping back to see my mere bike backdropped by this massive modern port evoked loads of emotion. Although every recent mile pushed the ball further into new territory, crossing the border validated that I had, in fact, reached new lands, and the dream of overlanding this land mass was truly underway.
